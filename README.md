First personal project for Wendy of RED VELVET Kpop group



MAIN OBJECTIVE:  
The major goal is to successfully display the artist's profile and gallery while delivering a satisfying and enjoyable user experience. 
 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 
- Write clean, efficient HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. - Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness. - Implement animations and interactive elements as needed. 
ACHIEVEMENTS: 
- Successfully designed and developed a personal project - Learned the basics of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. - Learned how to do a minimal responsive website. (It is not 100% responsive) 
 
Short Backstory: This is my first-ever personal project. I created this because it was the artistâ€™s birthday and I wanted to do something for her and for the fans. With that being said, I developed this project with a minimal knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I hosted this one with https://ph.000webhost.com/. It was a good learning experience. (Developed around 2018)
